# AgriPrice AI

## Problem Statement
Small-scale farmers are often forced to sell crops at unfair prices due to subjective visual quality assessment by middlemen.

## Solution
AgriPrice AI uses Gemini 1.5 Flash to analyze crop images and generate an objective quality grade and fair price suggestion.

## Features
- AI-based crop quality grading
- Ripeness and defect detection
- Fair price suggestion
- Shareable quality report

## Google Technologies Used
- Gemini 1.5 Flash
- Google AI Studio
- Firebase
- Flutter

## Prototype (MVP)
This project includes a working AI proof-of-concept created using Google AI Studio.

## How the Prototype Works
1. Crop image is uploaded to Gemini
2. AI analyzes quality
3. Grade (A/B/C) is generated with explanation

## Future Scope
- Direct farmer-to-buyer marketplace
- Pest detection
- Offline AI
